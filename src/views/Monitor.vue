        <h2 class="pad">Checking for Bats</h2>
        <h4 class="pad"><i>The most effective ways</i></h4>
        <p class="pad"><b>When should I check?</b> Bats will usually inhabit the houses between <i>April and September</i>, as this is when they are not hibernating. Arrive at the bat house around sunset.</p>
        <p class="pad"><b>How should I check?</b> The easiest way to know if there are bats using the house is to <i>check for bat droppings</i> (also known as guano) <i>on the ground outside of the house</i>. An example of bat guano can be seen below.</p>
        <p class="pad">Other methods can include <i>shining a flashlight up into the house</i> (do not do this for too long or too often, as this can disturb potential bat inhabitants), or <i>waiting at night to see if you can observe any bats leaving the house</i>; bats typically start exiting the house about <i>30 minutes after sunset</i>, but can leave earlier or later.</p>
        <p class="pad"><b>What do I need to record bat calls?</b> You will need an ultrasonic microphone. If you have an iOS device, the Echo Meter Touch is a good, though pricey, option. Contact us to see if you can borrow such a device!</p>
        <p class="pad"><b>I don't see any bats!</b> If you do not see any bats, do not despair. As bat populations have been so low lately, there are going to be some uninhabited houses throughout the state. In addition, bats often do not inhabit a house for a year or so, simply because they do not find it or trust it as a safe space.</p>
        <p class="pad"><b style="color:red">Caution:</b> Please be careful around bat guano; <b>do not breathe the air directly around it or touch it with bare skin</b>, as it has been linked to a lung disease known as histoplasmosis. Take precautions when dealing with bat guano: wear gloves and a face mask when removing it, if necessary.</p>
