      <p>This is Team's 36 Citizen Science Bat House Monitoring Application!</p>
      <p>Many thanks for taking the time to look and view this project.</p>
      <p>
        The main idea of this project is data aggregation: if we can encourage
        users to contribute data, this helps immensely for endangered bat
        species across the state.

      <p>
        With all the data being stored in a PostgreSQL database, it's a matter
        of extracting that data, and correlating it with other factors. That is
        left as an (extensive) future project.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know there's plenty to think about in this world, but not having to
        deal with insects and pests outside of your home is always an
        appreciated thought.
