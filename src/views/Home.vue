      <p>This is Team's 36 Citizen Science Bat House Monitoring Application!</p>
      <p>Many thanks for taking the time to look and view this project.</p>
      <p>The main idea of this project is data aggregation: if we can encourage users to contribute data, this helps immensely for endangered bat species across the state.</p>
      <p>With all the data being stored in a PostgreSQL database, it's a matter of extracting that data, and correlating it with other factors. That is left as an (extensive) future project.</p>
      <p>We know there's plenty to think about in this world, but not having to deal with insects and pests outside of your home is always an appreciated thought.</p>
